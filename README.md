# WEBD-2008 - Fields of Mistria RPG Archive

## Project Description
This proposal is to develop a CMS to assist with managing character profiles and the NPCâ€™s gift preferences in the game Fields of Mistria. The CMS will assist with: a) tracking character profiles; b) managing gift preferences; c) enhancing player experience by providing accurate information; and d) allowing users to update and maintain content easily.

## Overview
Fields of Mistria RPG Archive is a not-for-profit organization dedicated to providing comprehensive guides and resources for the game Fields of Mistria. This nostalgic farming/life sim RPG offers players the chance to build the farm of their dreams, discover magic, romance, and adventure, and restore the idyllic village of Mistria to its former glory. The organization requires a web-based Content Management System (CMS) to manage and display detailed character profiles, including their gift preferences. This CMS will help fans and players increase the heart levels of NPCs by gifting them appropriate items based on their preferences, enhancing their gaming experience.
